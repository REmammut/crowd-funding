title: "Internet for Refugees by Refugees"

teaser: "<a href='http://ccc.de'>The Chaos Computer Club e.V.</a>, <a href='http://berlin.freifunk.net'>Freifunk Berlin</a> and the <a href='http://foerderverein.freie-netzwerke.de'>Förderverein freie Netzwerke e.V.</a> support <a href='http://refugeesemancipation.com'>Refugees Emancipation</a>, who have been ensuring that Internet cafes are built in refugee accommodations throughout Germany. RE has been able to build several cafes and give the people who live there the opportunity to obtain information and to communicate with the outside world. We want to help Refugees Emancipation gather resources to further expand their work. The first step is a fundraising campaign, which will start at the end of September."

## Why?

Asylum applicants find themselves in a precarious position — after they have fled from another precarious position. In Germany, they are often isolated and lack opportunities to participate in society. They are often subjected to numerous rules and sanctions in their housing, and on top of this, they are expected to understand complicated asylum procedures and manage bureaucratic hurdles, which are difficult even for people with proficiency in German.

With an Internet connection, people can not only keep in touch with their relatives and friends, but also communicate with the public, which often talks about refugees without talking with them. Refugees can also access information about their home countries, local laws, their rights, and translation aids.

Internet access, which many of us take for granted, is a privilege. This is unfortunate, and we believe that it should be a human right, and that it should be the State's responsibility to guarantee it. Even for refugees.

## What is our goal, and how can you help?
By the end of September, we'll have designed a fundraising campaign. Our goal is to equip RE with the resources they need to continue their work.

* Can you reach a large audience? Then stay up-to-date, and help us spread the word, when the time comes.
* Do you have experience with fundraising campaigns? Then we'd love to get your advice.
* Do you like to donate to worthy causes? Super, then donate to Refugees Emancipation once the campaign is launched.
* Can you help with design, text, programming, and—above all—your time? Great! Let <a href="mailto:fiona@arduina.net">Fiona</a> and <a href="mailto:ilmditsch@furorum.de">Daniel</a> know what you can help with.
